# Quick Career

## Live Site:

### My project name Quick Career. Simple description in my project:

- The navbar should have a brand name navigation options like Statistics, Applied Jobs, and Blog, and a
  button
- The homepage should have a Banner, Category List section, and Featured job
  section
- Create a JSON for the category and show 4 cards.
- Make another json file having a minimum of 6 job data.
- At first, the featured section will show the first four job cards containing all the
  information. This featured section will also contain a see
  all jobs button at the bottom of these cards.
- Clicking on the Apply Now button will add that job information to local storage.
- Create an Applied Jobs page showing all the applied jobs in a tabular/list view.
  Donâ€™t forget to add a banner at the top.
- Create a statistics page. It cannot be a simple line/bar chart.
- Create a 404 page
